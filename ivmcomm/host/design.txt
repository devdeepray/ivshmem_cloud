This is the daemon on the host.

Functions:
1. Orchestration of memory allocation and deallocation
2. Synchronization utils

Memory allocation:
1. Map a shm_id to a region in the shared memory
2. Keep track of this mapping
3. Keep track of permissions for each allocated segment
Deallocation:
1. Keep track of changed permissions
2. When everyone deallocates, delete mapping

Synchronization utils
1. Give condition variable semantics
2. Create cv using cv_id
3. acquire cv_id: Give lock to process.
4. release cv_id: Release lock to process.
5. wait cv_id: wait on cv. This should release the lock for this process
6. notify cv_id: notify on cv. This should acquire the lock and make the process proceed

Close connection is used to notify end of input

Protocol:

alloc request:
struct {
  int req_type; # 1: alloc 2: dealloc 3: create 4: acq 5: rel 6: wait 7: notify 8: del
  int id; # shared id of the mem region or the cv id
  int uid; # unique id for requester
  int wr_perm; # write permissions 1 = exc write 2 = write, anything else = read
}

alloc response:
struct {
  int size; # size in bytes
  int offset; # offset in bytes
  int err_no; # error code
}

dealloc response:
struct {
  int err_no;
}

cv_response {
  int err_no;
}
